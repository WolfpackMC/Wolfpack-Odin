# Wolfpack Odin


## What is Wolfpack Odin?

Wolfpack is the name given to the [modpacks](https://github.com/WolfpackMC) available on GitHub. Odin is the codename for the 1.16.5 modpack which contains mostly a mixture of magic and tech mods, with some optimizations and improvements put into it. The modpacks in general have no relative theme, and is mostly a cluster of mods that are deemed interesting to add by popular demand. You can think of it as a whole bunch of wires bundled together and shoved into any socket you could find on the Minecraft instance. That's basically modded for you.

## What are the mods?

A full list of the mods can be found in the raw [manifest.yml](https://github.com/WolfpackMC/Wolfpack-Odin/blob/master/manifest.yml), but that can be deemed a bit too lengthy and unexplanatory for some mods. Therefore, a more user-friendly list will be shown below.

### WIP

## Awesome. How do I get started?

I can't stress this enough as the validation of this process determines your success in launching this modpack. Currently, the modpack supports a [self-update](https://github.com/WolfpackMC/wolfpackmaker/) script using a MultiMC instance. The modpack also requires Java 8 64-bit **only.** No other versions of Java are supported. It is imperative that you *verify* your Java version, and ensure that it is indeed, Java 8. The terminal Java version output will show as `1.8.0`, that's fine as well.

### tl;dr: Installation

1. Ensure that your Java installation is **Java 8 64-bit**. If you're not sure, open a terminal and type `java -version`. If it's not `1.8.0`, you don't have Java 8. You can easily get Java 8 [here.](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk)

2. Get [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download). Install as directed, and it should detect your Java version if you installed it. If you just downloaded the compressed archive, you'll need to tell MultiMC where Java 8 is.

3. Select `Add Instance`, select `Import from zip`, and paste the [link](https://github.com/WolfpackMC/Wolfpack-Odin/releases/download/1.2.2/Wolfpack-Odin.zip) to the instance zip file. Hit OK and you should be able to launch as soon as it's done importing. You're done.

    - If you are running Linux/macOS, you might need to right click the instance before starting, go to the `Settings` tab and select `Custom commands`. Set the `$INST_DIR\src\multimc.bat` to `$INST_DIR/src/multimc.sh` and add an `sh` at the beginning.
